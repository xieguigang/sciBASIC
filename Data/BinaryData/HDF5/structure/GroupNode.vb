    ''' <summary>
    ''' A group is an object internal to the file that allows arbitrary nesting of objects within the 
    ''' file (including other groups). A group maps a set of link names in the group to a set of 
    ''' relative file addresses of objects in the file. Certain metadata for an object to which the 
    ''' group points can be cached in the group’s symbol table entry in addition to being in the 
    ''' object’s header.
    ''' 
    ''' An HDF5 Object name space can be stored hierarchically by partitioning the name into components 
    ''' And storing Each component As a link In a group. The link For a non-ultimate component points 
    ''' To the group containing the Next component. The link For the last component points To the 
    ''' Object being named.
    '''
    ''' One implementation Of a group Is a collection Of symbol table nodes indexed by a B-tree. 
    ''' Each symbol table node contains entries For one Or more links. If an attempt Is made To add 
    ''' a link To an already full symbol table node containing 2K entries, Then the node Is split 
    ''' And one node contains K symbols And the other contains K+1 symbols.

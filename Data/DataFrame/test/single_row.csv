17,Burdock,Arctium lappa,"Arctium lappa, commonly called greater burdock, gob?,edible burdock, lappa, or beggar's buttons, is a biennial plant of the Arctium (burdock) genus in the Asteraceae family, cultivated in gardens for its root used as a vegetable. It is an invasive weed of high-nitrogen soils.
The root contains a fair amount of gob≈ç dietary fiber (GDF, 6g per 100g), calcium, potassium, amino acids, and is low calorie. It contains polyphenols that causes darkened surface and muddy harshness by formation of tannin-iron complexes. Those polyphenols are caffeoylquinic acid derivatives.
The root is very crisp and has a sweet, mild, and pungent flavor with a little muddy harshness that can be reduced by soaking julienned/shredded roots in water for five to ten minutes. The harshness shows excellent harmonization with pork in miso soup (tonjiru) and takikomi gohan (a Japanese-style pilaf).",36545,Arctium_lappa,17.jpg,image/jpeg,127987,2012-04-20 09:34:44 UTC,17,Vegetables,Root vegetables,Type 1,2011-02-09 00:37:15 UTC,2019-05-14 18:04:13 UTC,,,false,specific,4217,true,FOOD00017

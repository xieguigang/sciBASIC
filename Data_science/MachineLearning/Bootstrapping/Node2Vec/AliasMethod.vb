    ' 	 *
    ' 	 * An implementation of the alias method implemented using Vose's algorithm.
    ' 	 * The alias method allows for efficient sampling of random values from a
    ' 	 * discrete probability distribution (i.e. rolling a loaded die) in O(1) time
    ' 	 * each after O(n) preprocessing time.
    ' 	 *
    ' 	 * For a complete writeup on the alias method, including the intuition and
    ' 	 * important proofs, please see the article "Darts, Dice, and Coins: Smpling
    ' 	 * from a Discrete Distribution" at

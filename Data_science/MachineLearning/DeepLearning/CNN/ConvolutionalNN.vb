    ''' <summary>
    ''' A network class holding the layers and some helper functions
    ''' for training and validation.
    ''' 
    ''' Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a regularized type of feed-forward 
    ''' neural network that learns feature engineering by itself via filters
    ''' (or kernel) optimization. Vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, 
    ''' seen during backpropagation in earlier neural networks, are prevented by 
    ''' using regularized weights over fewer connections.

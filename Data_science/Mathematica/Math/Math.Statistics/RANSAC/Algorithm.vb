    ''' <summary>
    ''' RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) is an algorithm for measuring 
    ''' system parameters for some input data.
    ''' A common task For this algorithm Is To find the median subset 
    ''' Of a specified Set. For the regular spaces, the subset Is:
    '''
    ''' + 2D space - a line
    ''' + 3D space - a plane
    ''' 
    ''' This implementation presents a search Of a median plane For 
    ''' a random (Or loaded) Set Of points In 3D space.

    ''' <summary>QR Decomposition.
    ''' For an m-by-n matrix A with m >= n, the QR decomposition is an m-by-n
    ''' orthogonal matrix Q and an n-by-n upper triangular matrix R so that
    ''' A = Q*R.
    ''' 
    ''' The QR decompostion always exists, even if the matrix does not have
    ''' full rank, so the constructor will never fail.  The primary use of the
    ''' QR decomposition is in the least squares solution of nonsquare systems
    ''' of simultaneous linear equations.  This will fail if IsFullRank()
    ''' returns false.

    ''' <summary>
    ''' ### Gaussian elimination
    ''' 
    ''' In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm 
    ''' for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of row-wise 
    ''' operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can 
    ''' also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, 
    ''' and the inverse of an invertible matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich 
    ''' Gauss (1777–1855). To perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of
    ''' elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of 
    ''' the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of 
    ''' elementary row operations:
    ''' 
    ''' + Swapping two rows,
    ''' + Multiplying a row by a nonzero number,
    ''' + Adding a multiple Of one row To another row.
    ''' 
    ''' Using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular
    ''' matrix, And In fact one that Is In row echelon form. Once all Of the leading coefficients 
    ''' (the leftmost nonzero entry In Each row) are 1, And every column containing a leading
    ''' coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix Is said To be In reduced row echelon form.
    ''' This final form Is unique; In other words, it Is independent Of the sequence Of row
    ''' operations used. For example, In the following sequence Of row operations (where two 
    ''' elementary operations On different rows are done at the first And third steps), the 
    ''' third And fourth matrices are the ones In row echelon form, And the final matrix Is 
    ''' the unique reduced row echelon form.

    ' The repository pattern (in VB.Net)

    ' Background
    ' The repository pattern Is a method To introduce a shearing layer between your business objects And
    ' the data access/persistence technology you are Using And this especially useful In unit testing As
    ' the alternative(mocking an entire data access library) can be quite heart breaking.

    ' Motivation
    ' The repository pattern introduces the following advantages over the traditional three-tier architecture over an ORM:

    ' 1. The classes persisted by an ORM (Entity framework Or the Like) need To have a good deal Of information about how they are stored.
    '    This Is Not ideal because When you make a change To the underlying storage you would need To change the business objects As well.
    ' 2. Not all persistence Is in the form of a relational database - the repository can be backed by a blended storage made of files,
    '    database tables And NoSQL records As well.
    ' 3. Some fields exist only In order To allow navigation To a record Or To identify child records - these fields should Not
    '    be passed up into the business layer If they have no business meaning.

    ''' A **ranking** is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, 
    ''' the first is either 'ranked higher than', 'ranked lower than' or 'ranked equal to' 
    ''' the second. In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. 
    ''' It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have 
    ''' the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. For example, materials 
    ''' are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered.

        ''' 
        ''' It is not always possible to assign rankings uniquely. For example, in a race 
        ''' or competition two (or more) entrants might tie for a place in the ranking. 
        ''' When computing an ordinal measurement, two (or more) of the quantities being 
        ''' ranked might measure equal. In these cases, one of the strategies shown below 
        ''' for assigning the rankings may be adopted. A common shorthand way to distinguish 
        ''' these ranking strategies is by the ranking numbers that would be produced for 
        ''' four items, with the first item ranked ahead of the second and third (which 
        ''' compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of the fourth.

        ''' ###### Modified competition ranking ("1334" ranking)
        ''' 
        ''' Sometimes, competition ranking is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers before the sets 
        ''' of equal-ranking items (rather than after them as in standard competition ranking).[where?] The 
        ''' number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less than the number of items that 
        ''' compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal 
        ''' to it or above it. This ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if they score higher than 
        ''' all but one of their opponents, third if they score higher than all but two of their opponents, etc.
        ''' 
        ''' Thus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked head of D, then A gets 
        ''' ranking number 1 ("first"), B gets ranking number 3 ("joint third"), C also gets ranking number 3 
        ''' ("joint third") and D gets ranking number 4 ("fourth"). In this case, nobody would get ranking number 
        ''' 2 ("second") and that would be left as a gap.

    ''' This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return
    ''' collections.  It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on
    ''' collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a
    ''' specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.
    ''' 
    ''' &lt;p>The methods of this class all throw a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>
    ''' if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.
    ''' 
    ''' &lt;p>The documentation for the polymorphic algorithms contained in this class
    ''' generally includes a brief description of the <i>implementation</i>.  Such
    ''' descriptions should be regarded as <i>implementation notes</i>, rather than
    ''' parts of the <i>specification</i>.  Implementors should feel free to
    ''' substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered
    ''' to.  (For example, the algorithm used by <tt>sort</tt> does not have to be
    ''' a mergesort, but it does have to be <i>stable</i>.)
    ''' 
    ''' &lt;p>The "destructive" algorithms contained in this [Class], that is, the
    ''' algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified
    ''' to throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the collection does not
    ''' support the appropriate mutation primitive(s), such as the <tt>set</tt>
    ''' method.  These algorithms may, but are not required to, throw this
    ''' exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For
    ''' example, invoking the <tt>sort</tt> method on an unmodifiable list that is
    ''' already sorted may or may not throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.
    '''

        '     * two implementations, one of which is appropriate for RandomAccess
        '     * lists, the other for "sequential."  Often, the random access variant
        '     * yields better performance on small sequential access lists.  The
        '     * tuning parameters below determine the cutoff point for what constitutes
        '     * a "small" sequential access list for each algorithm.  The values below
        '     * were empirically determined to work well for LinkedList. Hopefully
        '     * they should be reasonable for other sequential access List
        '     * implementations.  Those doing performance work on this code would
        '     * do well to validate the values of these parameters from time to time.
        '     * (The first word of each tuning parameter name is the algorithm to which
        '     * it applies.)

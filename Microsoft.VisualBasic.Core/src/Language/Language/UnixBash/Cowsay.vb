    <Package("Cowsay",
                  Description:="cowsay is a program which generates ASCII pictures of a cow with a message.[2] 
                  It can also generate pictures using pre-made images of other animals, such as Tux the Penguin, the Linux mascot. 
                  It is written in Perl. There is also a related program called cowthink, with cows with thought bubbles rather than speech bubbles. .
                  cow files for cowsay exist which are able to produce different variants of ""cows"", with different kinds of ""eyes"", 
                  and so forth.[3] It is sometimes used on IRC, desktop screenshots, and in software documentation. 
                  It is more or less a joke within hacker culture, but has been around long enough that its use is rather widespread. 
                  In 2007 it was highlighted as a Debian package of the day.

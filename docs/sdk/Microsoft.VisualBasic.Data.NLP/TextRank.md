_namespace: [Microsoft.VisualBasic.Data.NLP](./index.md)_

This module implements TextRank, an unsupervised keyword
 significance scoring algorithm. TextRank builds a weighted
 graph representation Of a document Using words As nodes
 And coocurrence frequencies between pairs of words as edge 
 weights.It then applies PageRank to this graph, And
 treats the PageRank score of each word as its significance.
 The original research paper proposing this algorithm Is

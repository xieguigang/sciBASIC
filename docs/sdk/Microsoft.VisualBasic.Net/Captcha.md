Generate CAPTCHA graphics that you can use on websites to help authenticate users.
 CAPTCHA is an abbreviation for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.
 This method uses images Of words Or numbers that are, In theory, distorted And jumbled enough so that an 
 optical character recognition program can't read them but a human should be able to do so easily.

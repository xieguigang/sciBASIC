' v0.1 2013-04-22.  Initial release, Apr 22, 2013
' v0.2 2013-11-12.  Bug fix.  Corrected start of subpath in firstSideCCW().
' v0.3 2021-05-12.  Bug fix.  Corrected case 11 start of subpath in
'                   firstSideCCW() to return TOP, not RIGHT.

    ''' IsoCell is used to describe properties of data cells, in particular,
    ''' indicating whether neighbors are above or below a threshold value. Other
    ''' methods also help the caller follow isolines from cell to cell in a
    ''' counter-clockwise manner. That is useful when converting the isolines to
    ''' GeneralPaths.

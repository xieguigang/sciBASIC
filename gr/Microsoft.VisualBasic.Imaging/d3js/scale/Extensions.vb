    ''' <summary>
    ''' + Continuous scales map a continuous, quantitative input domain to a continuous output range. 
    '''   If the range is also numeric, the mapping may be inverted. A continuous scale is not 
    '''   constructed directly; instead, try a linear, power, log, identity, time or sequential color 
    '''   scale.
    ''' + Sequential scales are similar to continuous scales in that they map a continuous, numeric 
    '''   input domain to a continuous output range. However, unlike continuous scales, the output range 
    '''   of a sequential scale is fixed by its interpolator and not configurable. These scales do not 
    '''   expose invert, range, rangeRound and interpolate methods.
    ''' + Unlike continuous scales, ordinal scales have a discrete domain and range. For example, an 
    '''   ordinal scale might map a set of named categories to a set of colors, or determine the 
    '''   horizontal positions of columns in a column chart.

        ''' <summary>
        ''' > Ordinal scales have a discrete domain, such as a set of names or categories.
        ''' > An ordinal scale's values must be coercible to a string, and the stringified 
        ''' > version of the domain value uniquely identifies the corresponding range value.
        ''' 
        ''' So, as an example, a domain of an ordinal scale may contain names, like so:
        '''
        ''' ```javascript
        ''' var ordinalScale = d3.scale.ordinal()
        '''     .domain(['Alice', 'Bob'])
        '''     .range([0, 100]);
        '''
        ''' ordinalScale('Alice'); // 0
        ''' ordinalScale('Bob');   // 100
        ''' ```
        ''' 
        ''' Notice how all values are strings. They cannot be interpolated. What Is between 
        ''' 'Alice' and 'Bob'? I don't know. Neither does D3.

        ''' > Quantitative scales have a continuous domain, such as the set of real numbers, or dates.
        ''' 
        ''' As an example, you can construct the following scale:
        '''
        ''' ```javascript
        ''' var linearScale = d3.scale.linear()
        '''     .domain([0, 10])
        '''     .range([0, 100]);
        '''
        ''' linearScale(0);  // 0
        ''' linearScale(5);  // 50
        ''' linearScale(10); // 100
        ''' ```
        ''' 
        ''' Notice how D3 Is able To interpolate 5 even If we haven't specified it explicitly in the 
        ''' domain.
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <returns>
        ''' Constructs a new continuous scale with the unit domain [0, 1], the unit range [0, 1], 
        ''' the default interpolator and clamping disabled. Linear scales are a good default 
        ''' choice for continuous quantitative data because they preserve proportional differences. 
        ''' Each range value y can be expressed as a function of the domain value x: ``y = mx + b``.

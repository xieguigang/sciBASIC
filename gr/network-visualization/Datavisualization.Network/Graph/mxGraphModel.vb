	''' <summary>
	''' Extends mxEventSource to implement a graph model. The graph model acts as
	''' a wrapper around the cells which are in charge of storing the actual graph
	''' datastructure. The model acts as a transactional wrapper with event
	''' notification for all changes, whereas the cells contain the atomic
	''' operations for updating the actual datastructure.
	''' 
	''' Layers:
	''' 
	''' The cell hierarchy in the model must have a top-level root cell which
	''' contains the layers (typically one default layer), which in turn contain the
	''' top-level cells of the layers. This means each cell is contained in a layer.
	''' If no layers are required, then all new cells should be added to the default
	''' layer.
	''' 
	''' Layers are useful for hiding and showing groups of cells, or for placing
	''' groups of cells on top of other cells in the display. To identify a layer,
	''' the <isLayer> function is used. It returns true if the parent of the given
	''' cell is the root of the model.
	''' 
	''' This class fires the following events:
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.CHANGE fires when an undoable edit is dispatched. The <code>edit</code>
	''' property contains the mxUndoableEdit. The <code>changes</code> property
	''' contains the list of undoable changes inside the undoable edit. The changes
	''' property is deprecated, please use edit.getChanges() instead.
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.EXECUTE fires between begin- and endUpdate and after an atomic
	''' change was executed in the model. The <code>change</code> property contains
	''' the atomic change that was executed.
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.BEGIN_UPDATE fires after the updateLevel was incremented in
	''' beginUpdate. This event contains no properties.
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.END_UPDATE fires after the updateLevel was decreased in endUpdate
	''' but before any notification or change dispatching. The <code>edit</code>
	''' property contains the current mxUndoableEdit.
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.BEFORE_UNDO fires before the change is dispatched after the update
	''' level has reached 0 in endUpdate. The <code>edit</code> property contains
	''' the current mxUndoableEdit.
	''' 
	''' mxEvent.UNDO fires after the change was dispatched in endUpdate. The
	''' <code>edit</code> property contains the current mxUndoableEdit.
